We're on Twitter! Follow The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association (JAOA) on Twitter at <a href='https://twitter.com/TheJAOA'>@TheJAOA</a> for updates, highlights, and conversations about the JAOA and osteopathic medical research.

SCOPUS <a href='http://www.scimagojr.com/compare.php?j1=Journal+of+the+American+Osteopathic+Association%2C+The&j2=American+Family+Physician&j3=Physical+Medicine+and+Rehabilitation+Clinics+of+North+America&j4=International+Journal+of+Osteopathic+Medicine&un=journals&inj=0'>has released</a> its SCImage journal rankings for 2012. JAOA rankings have gone up for the second year in a row. Check out the JAOA's SCImago Journal & Country ranking. 

------------------------------
<p>Did you know the JAOA is interested in basic science articles? Here's what you can do to help increase such submissions:</p>

<p>Explain to students and researchers outside of the osteopathic profession how their research may build on the evidence base of the osteopathic tenets.</p>

<p>Encourage these investigators to submit their basic science research articles to the JAOA. Researchers who prefer to publish their studies in basic science journals should be encouraged to submit derivative articles, in which they explain how their original work connects to and supports the tenets.</p>

<p>Send the JAOA's Information for Authors [http://www.jaoa.org/site/misc/ifora.xhtml] to those interested in submitting basic science research or derivative articles with appropriate clinical applications. Also consider sharing the AOA's Tenets of Osteopathic Medicine [http://www.osteopathic.org/inside-aoa/about/leadership/Pages/tenets-of-osteopathic-medicine.aspx] page.</p> 

<p>Share the JAOA's most recently published basic science research article from the November 2013 issue. Paul R. Standley, PhD, and his colleagues' article, "In Vitro Biomechanical Strain Regulation of Fibroblast Wound Healing," [http://www.jaoa.org/content/113/11/806.abstract] is an excellent example of how basic science research can serve as an evidence base for the osteopathic tenets.</p>

Meet Your Peer: Michael A. Seffinger, DO
------------------------------
OCCUPATION: Professor and chair of the Department of NMM/OMM at the Western University of Health Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine in the Pacific and the Pacific Northwest, and JAOA associate editor.

SCHOOL/CLASS: Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, Class of 1988.

I AM INVOLVED WITH THE JAOA BECAUSE ...: I want to contribute to this vital communication link that keeps the osteopathic profession alive and viable. I want to facilitate open and productive scientific, peer-reviewed discourse among osteopathic physicians and our students in particular, as well as anyone else interested in osteopathic medicine. I want to promote the JAOA as a professional scientific journal that is interactive, evidence based, and up to date with state-of-the-art concepts about health and disease from an osteopathic perspective.  

WHEN REVIEWING A MANUSCRIPT, I ALWAYS CONSIDER ...: Whether it is meaningful to our profession, makes a significant contribution to the scientific literature, describes valid and appropriate methodology, reviews pertinent literature, clearly and accurately reports and interprets the data, and states the conclusions based only on the data obtained. The manuscript should make sense, state its limitations and strengths, and make recommendations for further study.

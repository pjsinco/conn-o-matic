Welcome to our very first newsletter designed to keep you up-to-date and involved with the JAOA.												

We envision this newsletter to be both a way to keep us all connected and an important source of helpful information with regard to your responsibilities as peer reviewers for the JAOA.											
Watch for our new look ...
coming in the January 2012 issue.

The Good, The Bad, and The Reviewer												
At OMED, Dr D'Alonzo shared his philosophy about peer reviewing in saying that whatever comments you write should always be intended to make the manuscript better. When reviewing, push yourself a bit further to tell the author specifically what works and what does not. Simply stating "good" or "bad" will leave the author feeling either validated or offended rather than encouraged to improve his or her writing. Providing specific suggestions will make a notable difference in both the manuscript you are reviewing and in the author's overall writing skills. 
* Is the manuscript missing references? Bring this to the author's attention.
* Let the author know something is working well—for example, explain how the data they have presented further proves their point.
* If you aren't sure why certain information has been presented to you as a reader, let the author know. What may seem clear or confusing to you will likely resound with fellow readers.

Why I'm a peer reviewer: I have been a peer reviewer for the JAOA since 1994 because of my interest in producing the highest quality manuscripts possible for publication. I have seen the JAOA grow in quality over the years and am committed to sustaining its growth as a source of information about all matters osteopathic.												

When completing a peer review ... When completing a peer review, I always consider the strength of the design and the quality and nature of the citations. I often find that authors could have used a better citation and sometimes have misconstrued what they have cited. In two instances I have felt the data were so important to report and the manuscript so poorly written that I have volunteered to help revise the manuscript.
